# Maze Simulation Game
The console application that generates a random maze using the depth-first search algorithm and allows the user to play the maze game by navigating through the maze using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys. The game ends when the user reaches the end of the maze or quits by pressing the 'q' key.

The code includes functions for setting the console size and color, drawing the background and image, initializing and generating the maze, displaying the maze on the screen, and solving the maze using the depth-first search algorithm.

The main function sets the console size, draws the background and image, and calls the playMazeGame function to start the maze game. The playMazeGame function initializes and generates the maze, displays the maze on the screen, reads user input, updates the current cell based on the user input, and checks if the user has reached the end of the maze.
